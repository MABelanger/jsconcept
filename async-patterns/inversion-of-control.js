	As soon we can take te continuation of our protram and wrap 
	it up into a function and hand that off to some utility
	we have lost control of our program we give control to the
	tird party API, call my callback when you done...

	What happen if the library have bug and call the function 1000 times
	if is a ecomerce and it charge 1000 times on the credit card.

	The gold is to solve inversion of control in a different way than callback
